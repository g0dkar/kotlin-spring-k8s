# Kotlin, Spring Boot, K8S

A scaffold project I built to have something to start building a Spring Boot Reactive project using Kotlin Coroutines and supporting deployment over Kubernetes.

It also includes utilities for helping out with creating/managing the project DBMS schema (Liquibase), tests (Jupiter, Functional and Integration Tests) and some other stuff :)
